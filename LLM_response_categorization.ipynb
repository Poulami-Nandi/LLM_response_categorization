Her thick, matted hair cascaded down her back, and her skin was tanned and rough from years of living in the harsh wilderness. Ula's husband, Kadan, was a skilled hunter and provided for their small tribe. But lately, even his sharpest arrows seemed to fall short, and food had become scarce.\\\\n\\\\nUla felt a deep ache in her bones and her swollen belly. It was the third trimester, and her baby was growing rapidly. She wondered if she would ever be able to give birth in the cramped, narrow cave. Ula's tribe had no midwife, and her only hope was to rely on the wisdom passed down from her own mother.\\\\n\\\\nOne day, while Kadan was out hunting, Ula went into labor. Her screams echoed through the cave, and her tribe gathered around her in a frenzy. Ula's eyes widened as she felt the intense pain of contractions. She was afraid for her baby's life and her own.\\\\n\\\\nThe tribe tried to comfort Ula, but their efforts fell short. Ula's baby was too big, and the birth seemed impossible. Hours passed, and Ula lost all strength. Her tribe watched in horror as Ula's life slipped away. Suddenly, a loud cry broke the silence. Ula's baby had been born, and he was healthy and strong.\\\\n\\\\nThe tribe rejoiced at the sight of the newborn. They named him Kade, after Ula's husband, Kadan. Kade was a symbol of hope and resilience, and his birth brought new life and energy to the tribe.\\\\n\\\\nAs Ula took her last breath, she whispered to Kade, \\\\\\\"May you grow up to be a fierce and proud caveman, just like your father.\\\\\\\" Ula's legacy lived on through her son, and her tribe honored her memory by carving her name into the walls of the cave.
